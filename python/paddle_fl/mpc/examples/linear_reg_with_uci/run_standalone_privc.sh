# A tools to faciliate the parallel running of fluid_encrypted test scrips.
# A test script is EXPECTED to accepted arguments in the following format:
#
# SCRIPT_NAME $ROLE $SERVER $PORT
#   ROLE:    the role of the running party
#   SERVER:  the address of the party discovering service
#   PORT:    the port of the party discovering service
#
# This tool will try to fill the above three argument to the test script,
# so that totally three processes running the script will be started, to
# simulate run of three party in a standalone machine.
#
# Usage of this script:
#
# bash run_standalone.sh TEST_SCRIPT_NAME
#

# please set the following environment vars according in your environment
